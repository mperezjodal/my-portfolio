                    My passions are: ideas, technology, literature and people.
                    My dream is to help create new and inspiring innovations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Iâ€™m awed by the immensely wonderful culture we are a part of,
                    and thrilled when attempting to conceive what may come next.
                    I am optimistic and skeptical.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I constantly try to undertake new challenges.
                    In team discussions, I like pondering those
                    ideas that I believe are being understated
                    and giving them a say.
